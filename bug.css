The CSS code uses a vendor prefix that is no longer necessary or supported by modern browsers. This can lead to unexpected styling issues or the styles not being applied at all. For example, using `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, or `-ms-` prefixes for properties that now have standard implementations (like `transform`, `transition`, `flexbox` etc.).
